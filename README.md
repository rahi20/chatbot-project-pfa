# Run MelliBot
**MelliBot** is a chatbot that answers the most frequently asked questions about diabetes and gives you the contact details of endocrinologists of the entered city (Morocco).
 
 To run the chatbot, install the dependencies first using `requirements.txt`. To do so, in the root folder run : `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Then run in the same folder run : `python3 mellibot.py`
 
 To train the chatbot, run either the notebook `intent-ident-keras.ipynb` or the script `intent-ident-keras.py`, they both save the model trained in the file `saved_models_vars/bot_hypermodel.h5`.
 
 For the data description read the `README.md` in the [data folder](https://github.com/rahi20/chatbot-project-pfa/tree/main/data)
